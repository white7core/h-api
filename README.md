[NOTICE] MAJOR UPDATE FOR THIS NEW 5.0 UPDATE

[INFO] This will be my last time fixing this code and so yeah docs will also be updated later.


# HaniAPI  
**Hanime API Build with Python Flask**

AND WHY not Choose THIS ONE?

- Fast API  
- Open Source
- Free To Use For Your Project
- Unrestrict Access to Some API (getVideo won't give you 1080p video)  
- Never Wasting your time building your own one
- You can MAYBE bypass cloudflare blocking If you cannot go and open the app to collect coins???  
- More API Features than The Original One:  
  - Get Comments, (Replies, Other Replies) from Hanime video
  - Get Landing From the front page of the Hanime.tv
  - Authentication (*Does not support sign-up*) [Original Idea](#author--credits)
  - Collect Coins Without Clicking On Ads [Original Idea](#author--credits)
  - Checking Your Channel or Other User Channel
  - Community Upload
  - Search
  - Request 1080p Video using X-Session-Token
  - Browse Tags & Brands
